### Instructions

1. In this simple calculator, you can input the numbers and operators through clicking or using the keyboard.

2. You can only input the numbers upto ten digits ex. "9999999999".

3. Dividing any number by "0" will result in math.error and you can only click "AC" button.

4. If the result of your calculation exceeds the ten digit mark, the result will only show few of the resulting numbers with "..." at the end, thus you cannot continue the calculations because only the "AC" button will be active. (Again this is just a simple calculator :D).

(as for now these are the functions of this calculator :)).
